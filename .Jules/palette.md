## 2026-05-22 - Missing Accessibility Utility Classes
**Learning:** Invanilla HTML/CSS projects, utility classes like `.visually-hidden` must be manually defined in the stylesheet. Simply adding them to the HTML is insufficient and will result in screen reader text becoming visible on the screen.
**Action:** Always ensure that when using utility classes for accessibility (like `.visually-hidden`) or state (like `:focus-visible`), their definitions are explicitly added to the global `style.css`.

## 2024-05-21 - [Accessibility] Missing utility classes
**Learning:** Found elements in the DOM with classes like `.visually-hidden` that were not actually defined in the stylesheet. This causes elements meant only for screen readers to visibly render on screen, creating confusion.
**Action:** Always verify that utility classes referenced in HTML actually exist in the CSS file, and consider standardizing a base set of accessibility classes for every project.
## 2024-11-20 - Missing Utility Classes
**Learning:** Found that accessibility-focused utility classes like `.visually-hidden` were being used in the HTML markup (`mensagem.html`) to hide screen reader text (`#status-announcer`) but were never actually defined in the shared CSS (`style.css`), meaning the text was visibly exposed or broken.
**Action:** Always verify that utility classes referenced in markup are properly defined in the corresponding stylesheets, particularly those affecting accessibility visibility.

## 2024-11-20 - Inline Validation Accessibility
**Learning:** For screen readers to properly announce inline form validation errors in vanilla JS, you must explicitly connect the input to the error message (`aria-describedby`), make the error container live (`aria-live="polite"`), and dynamically toggle the invalid state on the input itself (`aria-invalid="true"/"false"`).
**Action:** When implementing custom regex validation or input masking in vanilla JS forms, always include these three ARIA attributes to ensure the error state is communicable to assistive technologies.
