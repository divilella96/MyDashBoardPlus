## 2026-05-22 - Missing Accessibility Utility Classes
**Learning:** Invanilla HTML/CSS projects, utility classes like `.visually-hidden` must be manually defined in the stylesheet. Simply adding them to the HTML is insufficient and will result in screen reader text becoming visible on the screen.
**Action:** Always ensure that when using utility classes for accessibility (like `.visually-hidden`) or state (like `:focus-visible`), their definitions are explicitly added to the global `style.css`.

## 2024-05-21 - [Accessibility] Missing utility classes
**Learning:** Found elements in the DOM with classes like `.visually-hidden` that were not actually defined in the stylesheet. This causes elements meant only for screen readers to visibly render on screen, creating confusion.
**Action:** Always verify that utility classes referenced in HTML actually exist in the CSS file, and consider standardizing a base set of accessibility classes for every project.
## 2024-11-20 - Missing Utility Classes
**Learning:** Found that accessibility-focused utility classes like `.visually-hidden` were being used in the HTML markup (`mensagem.html`) to hide screen reader text (`#status-announcer`) but were never actually defined in the shared CSS (`style.css`), meaning the text was visibly exposed or broken.
**Action:** Always verify that utility classes referenced in markup are properly defined in the corresponding stylesheets, particularly those affecting accessibility visibility.

## 2024-05-18 - Missing labels on placeholder-only inputs
**Learning:** Text inputs that rely solely on `placeholder` attributes (like `#streetInput` and `.order-input`) break screen reader accessibility, as placeholders are not reliably announced as labels.
**Action:** Always provide an explicit `<label>` or add `aria-label` to inputs when visible labels are omitted for design reasons.
